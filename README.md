# **Waste Material Segregation for Improving Waste Management**
## **Objective**

The objective of this project is to implement an effective waste material segregation system using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that categorises waste into distinct groups. This process enhances recycling efficiency, minimises environmental pollution, and promotes sustainable waste management practices.

The key goals are:

* Accurately classify waste materials into categories like cardboard, glass, paper, and plastic.
* Improve waste segregation efficiency to support recycling and reduce landfill waste.
* Understand the properties of different waste materials to optimise sorting methods for sustainability.
* ## **Data Understanding**

The Dataset consists of images of some common waste materials.

1. Food Waste
2. Metal
3. Paper
4. Plastic
5. Other
6. Cardboard
7. Glass
**Data Description**

* The dataset consists of multiple folders, each representing a specific class, such as `Cardboard`, `Food_Waste`, and `Metal`.
* Within each folder, there are images of objects that belong to that category.
* However, these items are not further subcategorised. <br> For instance, the `Food_Waste` folder may contain images of items like coffee grounds, teabags, and fruit peels, without explicitly stating that they are actually coffee grounds or teabags.
